Father, will you forgive me for my sins? 
Father, if there's a heaven, let me in. 
I don't know where to go if I should die.
We haven't been on speaking terms for so long, you and I. 

I was a freak since 7-years old.
Been cast away, I felt the cold
Coming over me.

For every love I had to hide, 
And every tear I ever cried,
I'm down on my knees.
I'm begging you, please.
There's no place in heaven for someone like me. 

Won't you open the door 
And try me once more?
'Cause there's no place in heaven for someone like me
'Cause there's no place in hea... 

In between a solution can be found.
How long will I swim before I drown?
And in between those words we dare not say,
Do you think that you could learn to love me anyway?

I was a freak since 7-years old.
Been cast away, I felt the cold
Coming over me.

For every love I had to hide, 
And every tear I ever cried,
I'm down on my knees.
I'm begging you, please.
There's no place in heaven for someone like me. 

Won't you open the door 
And try me once more?
'Cause there's no place in heaven for someone like me

Oh, I'm down on my knees.
I'm begging you, please.
There's no place in heaven for someone like me. 
'Cause there's no place in heaven for someone like me
'Cause there's no place in hea... 

Father, won't you forgive me for my sins? 
Father, if there's a heaven, let me in. 
Father is there any way to see 
if there's room in heaven left for me?

I'm down on my knees.
I'm begging you, please.
There's no place in heaven for someone like me. 

Won't you open the door 
And try me once more?
'Cause there's no place in heaven for someone like me

Oh, I'm down on my knees.
I'm begging you, please.
There's no place in heaven for someone like me. 
There's no place in heaven for me.
